# LAMP-on-Amazon-AMI
Script for installing LAMP and setting up a basic firewall on an EC2 instance on Amazon's AMI.

Installation.sh will install LAMP and setup some basic settings for Apache on an EC2 instance using Amazon's AMI (NOT Amazon's Linux2).
Implementation.sh will setup basic firewall settings using IPTables.

I transferred the files using Filezilla and accessed the instance using PuTTy.
